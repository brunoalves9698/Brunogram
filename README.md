## About this Project

A social network for publishing photos that is inspired by Instagram.

## Why?

This project was created for study purposes following the course "Criando PWAs com Angular 8, Ionic 4 e Firebase" on the [balta.io](https://balta.io/cursos/criando-pwas-com-angular-ionic-e-firebase) platform.

Now, this project is part of my personal portfolio, so I would be happy to provide me with any feedback on the project, code, structure or anything you can report that could make me a better developer!
